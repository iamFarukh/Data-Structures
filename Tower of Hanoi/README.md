# Tower of Hanoi
### Objective
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:  
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.  
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.  
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Example

    Input : 3
    Output : Disk 1 moved from A to C
             Disk 2 moved from A to B
             Disk 1 moved from C to B
             Disk 3 moved from A to C
             Disk 1 moved from B to A
             Disk 2 moved from B to C
             Disk 1 moved from A to C
